List of things to do for app translator.

Nice to have:
- more tests for store
- implement /app/${appName}/edits
- serveErrorMsg() => serveErrorMsgf() (httpErrorf() ?)
- use redirect after editing/duplicating (to avoid "reconfirm submission")
- show total number of edits on main page for the app
- use godep for building
