List of things to do for app translator.

Must have:
- before accepting a translation, verify the order of % escapes is correct
- download all translations in a single file
- upload strings to be translated
- user authentication via twitter
- ability to see history of translations for a given string and revert to any past translations
- ability to rename original string while preserving the translation
- only enable 'Submit' in edit translation form if the translation has changed
- add a new string for translation via web page

Nice to have:
- view recent translations (next to languages list on the summary page for the application)
- remember who did what translation, so that we can credit people
- a page that shows a log of changes (who, what, when)
- an RSS feed for each app/lang pair which shows currently untranslated
  strings (so that translators have an easy way to be notified about the
  need to translate)
- ability of anonymous users to edit translation. They would be put in
  a queue and would have to be verified/accepted by a signed in user
- user authentication via google
- user authentication via facebook
- import strings from other formats, like .po files, Cocoa's .nib files etc.
