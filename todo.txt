List of things to do for app translator.

Must have:
- upload strings to be translated
- python script to parse translations from app translator
- a way to backup data to s3 (e.g. every 1hr, if changed)
- allow for handleDownloadTranslations (/downloadtranslations) to not re-download
  translations if they haven't changed

Nice to have:
- ability to rename original string while preserving the translation
- ability to see history of translations for a given string and revert to any past translations
- a page that shows a log of changes (who, what, when)
- an RSS feed for each app/lang pair which shows currently untranslated
  strings (so that translators have an easy way to be notified about the
  need to translate)
