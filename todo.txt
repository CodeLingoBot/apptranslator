List of things to do for app translator.

Must have:

Nice to have:
- ability to rename original string while preserving the translation
- ability to see history of translations for a given string and revert to any past translations
- an RSS feed for each app/lang pair which shows currently untranslated
  strings (so that translators have an easy way to be notified about the
  need to translate)
